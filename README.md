# Chosen Family HCI Project

This repo hold all the code for our HCI Final Project

# Objective:
Our app aims to help people who are estranged or away from their family, and facilitate forming strong connections with others so they might become a found family. This app gamifies the development of preexisting friendships through a variety of in-person “quests”. The game is centered around making potions, where a player gathers ingredients by completing quests in real life with other players such as learning a new skill, going to the gym, or planning their future. Potions or “campaigns” (series of repeated quests) reward the player with apparel to customize their character.

# Operation Instructions:
#### todo

# Implemented Tasks:
## Simple: Initiating a quest
To initiate a quest, a user will navigate the many quest options on the map and be able to form their party with one or more friends. 
		Limitations: Quest initiation is only functional for the desert region at the moment and does not have a story aspect

## Moderate: Crafting Potions
Once a player has gathered ingredients by completing quests, they can craft potions by navigating to ____.
		Limitations: Only a few potions can be crafted, and they will not show up in your inventory after crafting.

## Moderate: Trading Potion
Successful bargaining by trading a potion with an NPC will reward the player with apparel, which can be used to customize their avatar.
		Limitations: Apparel is currently hard-coded into the player’s inventory, so trading in the potion will not result in any additional apparel or loss in potion inventory.

## Complex: Gaining Trust via Campaign
Successful bargaining of NPC’s trust through a campaign will reward the player with apparel which can be used to customize their avatar. Wanderers will need to commit to 1 quest for a repeated number of weeks/iterations to gain trust.
		Limitations: Campaign task flow is currently hard-coded, so starting one will not result in apparel that will show up in inventory. 


## Moderate: Modifying Avatar Appearance
Once Trading Potion or Gaining Trust via Campaign successfully result in apparel, the user may update their avatar in the settings
	Limitations: Apparel is currently hard-coded into the player’s inventory, so trading in the potion does not actually reward you.
